# mas-code-quiz

This project created code quiz that will dynamically update with new questions and log score to a high score list at the end. This high score list can be cleared and the quiz can be taken again. The purpose of this was to show us what we may experience during the interview process by creating the interview quiz. This quiz is timed and any wrong answers take time off of your score. Your final score is your remaining time.
